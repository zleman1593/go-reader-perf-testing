a simple go program that does the following:
It will be a learning tool that helps illustrate how buffered readers and writers work and perform compared to nobufio readers and writers. 

It will start a very simple HTTP server. I will be using curl to interact with the server. When it is curled the file from the source path will be downloaded by the curl command.  

It takes arguments:
Source file path
Port
Buffer size bytes (only relevant for BUFIOREADER execution)
Execution path enum with values:
NOBUFFER
BUFIOREADER
PRELOAD

For NOBUFFER there should be no buffered readers used before the file is written to the final httpWritter 

BUFIOREADER can use a bufioreader to read the file and transfer the content to the httpWritter.

PRELOAD
Will load the file into memory completely when the program starts and quickly be able to push its content to the httpWritter.

Make sure to add timers that log out for critical blocks of code for learning purposes.

Add useful comments in the code to explain any behind the scenes functionality. For example what the httpWritter is doing and if it has any buffers
